# Video Streaming Service, microservices/Docker/AWS  - Atypon Training Assignment Aug/2023

In this project I built a containerized Video Streaming System. Where this Web app is used to view videos.
Users are allowed to view videos after validating their credentials through the Authentication Service.
The list of videos and their paths are taken from MySql DB service, and the video itself can be read from the file storage (AWS) through the File storage system service.
